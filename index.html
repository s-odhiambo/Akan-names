        <p>This naming(Akan-Names) tradition is shared throughout West Africa and the African diaspora. During the
          18thâ€“19th centuries, slaves in the Caribbean from the region that is modern-day Ghana were referred to as
          Coromantees. Many of the leaders of slave rebellions had "day names" including Cuffy or Kofi, Cudjoe or
          Kojo, and Quamina or Kwame/Kwamina.
